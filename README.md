Below is the outline of the changes made to the Marketing Website:

    1.	Changed the website title

    2.	Changed ID tag to target search engine optimizer

    3.	Changed div tags to be more semanticaly correct

    4.	Created Alt tags for all images

    5.	We left all header elements in CSS becuase prior attemps to conndence the header elements resulted in unfixable (based on my minimal coding ability) problems.

    6.	Combined benifit lead, benifit brand, and benifit cost into one line of class.

    7.	Combined benifit h3 eliments, and the benifit elements
